                                <p>My name is Akshit Agarwal. I am currently a 
                                freshman at Dublin High School. I have a lot of 
                                hobbies like creating music, playing sports, or 
                                writing out stories. I've been interested in Computer
                                Science ever since I was a little kid, when my love 
                                for video games started. As I played classic Nintendo
                                games like Super Mario Sunshine and Donkey Kong, I 
                                always had wondered on how these games were actually
                                made. As I grew older and older, I became more and 
                                more interested in the field of Computer Science. 
                                While I grew, my passions for basketball and creating
                                music had taken off, as I spent my time practicing 
                                and learning, but I still never lost that wonder for
                                Computer Science. Now that I am in the class, I am 
                                excited for what's to come and I look forward to a 
                                year of coding!</p>
